💭 ReflectionStarted as a simple time widget, but I wanted it to be more than just functional — it had to be fun, cute, and memorable. Maxwell the spinning cat and Kirby tunes bring the cozy vibes, making this project a playful flex of my skills.

“Functional, deployed, and fun — that’s how I roll when I build in public.”
