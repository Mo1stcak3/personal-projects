## 💬 Reflection
This project started as a simple time.now widget — but I wanted to make it memorable.
So I added Maxwell the spinning cat as the background and layered in Kirby music for a cozy, meme-y vibe.
It’s a fun way to show I can build and deploy real projects while keeping things lighthearted.

## 🌍 Customizing Timezone

This widget currently displays time in the Philippines (Asia/Manila).  
If you'd like to adapt it to your own timezone, you can use the same API widget with your preferred location.

**API Source**: https://time.now/widget/digital-clock/

Just replace the embed code or script with your desired timezone from the widget generator.
