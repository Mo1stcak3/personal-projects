💬 Reflection

This project started as a simple time.now widget — but I wanted to make it memorable. So I added Maxwell the spinning cat as the background and layered in Kirby music for a cozy, meme-y vibe. It’s a fun way to show I can build and deploy real projects while keeping things lighthearted.

“Functional, deployed, and fun — this is how I learn and build in public.”
