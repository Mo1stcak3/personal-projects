Personal Projects 🚀
Welcome to my collection of personal projects!
I’m Rey Moises Sebastian, a sophomore IT student at Cavite State University – Cavite City Campus. This repository is where I experiment, learn, and showcase my growth in backend development, systems troubleshooting, and creative coding.

📂 Projects Included
- Backend Mini‑Apps – Flask, FastAPI, and SQL practice projects
- PC & Systems Work – Scripts and notes from hardware troubleshooting and system setups
- Learning Experiments – Small Python routines, ASCII art, and playful coding exercises
- Course Practice – Code snippets and exercises from LinkedIn Learning and CS50 Python

🛠️ Skills Highlighted
- PC building & troubleshooting (hands‑on strength)
- Introductory backend development (Python, Flask, FastAPI, SQL)
- Networking basics (DNS resolution, Packet Tracer simulations)
- GitHub workflow and documentation

🎯 Purpose
This repo is not about polished, production‑ready apps—it’s about learning in public.
I use it to:
- Track my progress across courses and certifications
- Build a portfolio recruiters can see evolve over time
- Share experiments and mini‑projects openly
